Project Title: Customer Sales & Revenue Analysis Using SQL

Business Problem

A retail company wants to understand:
	•	Which customer segments bring the most revenue
	•	Which products sell the best
	•	What the monthly revenue trend looks like
	•	Which customers are at risk of churn

This analysis will help the business make data-driven decisions on marketing, inventory, and retention strategies.
